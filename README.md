### üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application uses a modular, role-based access control system. At present, the roles and permissions are managed through a centralized static configuration file for simplicity and maintainability.

This setup ensures DRY principles and clean separation of access logic. The architecture supports future enhancement of dynamic role-permission mapping through backend models and admin UI without changing frontend code.
