# ✅ Software Development Improvement Checklist for Enterprise-based System

This document contains strategic improvement points to implement while developing a scalable, secure, and performant enterprise-wise scoped system.

---

## ✅ 1. Enterprise-wise Data Scoping

* [ ] All master and transactional data must be filtered by `selectedEnterprise`.
* [ ] Backend queries must include `enterpriseId` filter.
* [ ] Index `enterpriseId` fields in database for performance.

---

## ✅ 2. Lazy Loading / On-Demand Fetching

* [ ] Avoid bulk fetches on login or enterprise switch.
* [ ] Fetch module-level data only when user opens the module.

---

## ✅ 3. Modular Data Isolation in Redux or Context

* [ ] Reset related Redux slices on enterprise switch.
* [ ] Clear stale data post enterprise change.

---

## ✅ 4. Optimized LocalStorage Usage

* [ ] Only store token, selectedEnterpriseId, and minimal user data.
* [ ] Avoid storing full lists or transactional data.

---

## ✅ 5. Backend Query Filtering

* [ ] Apply `enterpriseId` filter in all controller queries.
* [ ] Use consistent scoping logic across CRUD APIs.

---

## ✅ 6. Smart Loading Feedback

* [ ] Use skeleton loaders for smooth transitions.
* [ ] Toast message for “Switching enterprise...” if delay > 500ms.

---

## ✅ 7. Background Prefetching (Optional)

* [ ] After enterprise switch, fetch 2–3 small master datasets in background.
* [ ] Do not block UI during this process.

---

## ✅ 8. Pagination, Search & Filters

* [ ] Implement pagination in all large datasets.
* [ ] Use search and filtering in table UIs.

---

## ✅ 9. Role + Enterprise Permission Merge

* [ ] Validate both role permissions and selected enterprise scope.
* [ ] Merge permissions dynamically.

---

## ✅ 10. Session Restoration & Rehydration

* [ ] On reload, restore session using token and selectedEnterpriseId.
* [ ] Fetch fresh user info, permissions, and configs.

---

## ✅ 11. Graceful Error Handling

* [ ] Use fallback UIs and retry buttons.
* [ ] Avoid blank screens or unresponsive UIs on error.

---

## ✅ 12. Memoization & State Caching

* [ ] Use memoization where data is reused.
* [ ] Temporarily cache frequently used master data.

---

## ✅ 13. Audit & Logs

* [ ] Log enterprise switch events with timestamps.
* [ ] Optional: maintain audit trails for access control.

---

## ✅ 14. Prevent Double API Hits

* [ ] Debounce search, switch, or filtering triggers.

---

## ✅ 15. Component Cleanup on Switch

* [ ] Reset form states and validation errors.
* [ ] Cleanup module-specific component states.

---

## ✅ UI/UX Enhancements

* [ ] Display toast message on enterprise switch.
* [ ] Use dropdowns with absolute positioning and z-50.
* [ ] Responsive layouts via Tailwind’s breakpoints.
* [ ] Add accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
